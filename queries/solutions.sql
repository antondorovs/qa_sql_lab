-- 13. Find users who do not have any orders.
SELECT id, email
FROM users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

ORDER BY id;

-- 14. Find orders above the average order amount.
SELECT id, order_number, amount
FROM orders
WHERE amount > (
    SELECT AVG(amount)
    FROM orders
)
ORDER BY amount DESC;

-- 15. Classify users into age groups: UNKNOWN, UNDER_18, ADULT, SENIOR.
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    age,
    CASE
        WHEN age IS NULL THEN 'UNKNOWN'

FROM users
ORDER BY id;

-- 16. Classify orders into QA risk levels based on amount and status.
SELECT

    order_number,
    status,
    amount,
    CASE
        WHEN amount < 0 THEN 'INVALID_AMOUNT'
        WHEN status = 'PAID' AND amount >= 200 THEN 'HIGH_VALUE_PAID'
        WHEN status = 'NEW' THEN 'AWAITING_PROCESSING'
        WHEN status = 'CANCELLED' THEN 'CANCELLED_ORDER'
        ELSE 'STANDARD'
    END AS qa_risk_level
FROM orders
ORDER BY id;

-- 17. Number each user's orders by creation date.
SELECT
    user_id,
    order_number,
    created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY created_at
    ) AS order_sequence
FROM orders
ORDER BY user_id, order_sequence;

-- 18. Rank orders by amount within each order status.
SELECT
    status,
    order_number,
    amount,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY status
        ORDER BY amount DESC
    ) AS amount_rank
FROM orders
ORDER BY status, amount_rank;

-- 19. Calculate a running total of order amounts by creation date.
SELECT
    order_number,
    created_at,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY created_at
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_total
FROM orders
ORDER BY created_at;

-- 20. Write an assertion query that returns active users without primary addresses.
SELECT u.id, u.email
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN addresses a
    ON u.id = a.user_id
   AND a.is_primary = TRUE
WHERE u.status = 'ACTIVE'
  AND a.id IS NULL;

-- 21. Write an assertion query that returns successful payments where amount differs from the order amount.
SELECT
    o.id AS order_id,
    o.order_number,
    o.amount AS order_amount,
    p.amount AS payment_amount
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN payments p
    ON o.id = p.order_id
WHERE p.status = 'SUCCESS'
  AND o.amount <> p.amount;

-- 22. Write a safe transaction that updates one order status, verifies it, and rolls it back.
BEGIN;

UPDATE orders
SET status = 'PAID'
WHERE id = 5;

SELECT id, order_number, status
FROM orders
WHERE id = 5;

ROLLBACK;
