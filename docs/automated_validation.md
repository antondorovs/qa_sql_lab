# Automated PostgreSQL Validation

The repository includes a repeatable test suite that creates the lab from scratch and validates it against PostgreSQL.

## What is tested

- Schema and seed scripts execute without errors.
- Dataset row counts match the documented sample data.
- Intentional QA defects remain available for exercises.
- Reusable views return stable columns and expected classifications.
- Every SQL example and solution executes successfully.

The checks treat the known bad records as test fixtures. A duplicate email or orphan payment is expected in this lab, so the tests verify that each scenario exists exactly once.

## Run locally

Create an empty PostgreSQL database and run:

```bash
psql -d qa_sql_lab -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f tests/run_all.sql
```

The runner resets the lab tables and views before loading the sample data. Do not run it against a database containing data you need to keep.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions starts PostgreSQL 16 and runs the same `tests/run_all.sql` entry point for every push and pull request targeting `main`.

When a SQL statement fails or a dataset contract changes unexpectedly, `psql` exits with an error and the workflow fails.
